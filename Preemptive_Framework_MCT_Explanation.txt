This is a program that simulates a genetic algorithm scheduler for a set of jobs. Each job has a name, a priority, a duration, and an energy value. Additionally, each job can have dependencies on other jobs. The goal is to find the order in which to execute the jobs so that the total completion time and energy consumption are minimized.

The program first defines a `Job` class with attributes and methods to represent a job, and a `GA_Scheduler` class with methods to generate a population of job orders, evaluate their fitness, select parents for crossover, perform crossover and mutation, and evolve the population for a number of generations.

The main function initializes a `jobs_dict` dictionary containing `Job` objects with specific attributes, and then initializes the `Job.jobs_dict` class variable to the same dictionary. It then creates a `GA_Scheduler` object and calls its `evolve` method with a number of generations as input.

The program works by evolving a population of job orders through genetic operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation. Each job order represents a potential solution to the scheduling problem. The fitness of each job order is evaluated by simulating the execution of the jobs in that order and calculating the total completion time and energy consumption. The genetic algorithm then generates new job orders by selecting parents from the current population, performing crossover to combine their genes, and mutating some of the resulting offspring. The process is repeated for a number of generations until a satisfactory solution is found.
